### Prompt 1

Create a modern Next.js + TypeScript app named scenic-sky (App Router, src/ layout) that demonstrates plotting and animating a Great-Circle flight path between two demo airports on an interactive, Google-Earth–style map. Use Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui for styling. Follow best practices for ESLint, TypeScript, and modular code organization. Do not include tests or project documentation/README. Instead, keep the code self-explanatory and add small inline comments where necessary to help a developer understand intent and tricky parts.

#### Tech stack (required)

Next.js (latest) with App Router and src/ folder structure.

TypeScript (strict mode enabled).

Tailwind CSS.

shadcn/ui for design components.

ESLint + Prettier (formatting + linting best practices).

Map library: MapLibre GL or Mapbox GL JS (prefer MapLibre for no token requirement) — must support satellite/imagery style, smooth zoom/drag, and layers.

Great-circle math: turf.js or d3-geo or a small custom spherical interpolation helper.

Animation: React + requestAnimationFrame (or a small abstraction) to animate the airplane along the path.

No testing frameworks, no CI, no README files — keep repository minimal.

**Important: Add concise comments in code where the logic is non-obvious (e.g., geodesic interpolation, bearing calculation, map layer updates). Comments should be short and helpful — not verbose documentation.**

#### Deliverables

A minimal Git repo scenic-sky with clear commits (no tests, no README).

A working, responsive homepage implementing UI + map features below.

Code organized and modular: app/, components/, lib/, hooks/, styles/.

ESLint + Prettier configured and runnable via npm/pnpm scripts.

Small inline comments added where helpful to explain non-trivial code.

Homepage — requirements & behavior
Layout & general

Polished, responsive UI using shadcn/ui + Tailwind.

Accessibility: semantic HTML, keyboard-operable form controls, ARIA where useful.

Hero section includes the flight form.

Hero form inputs (demo values only)

Airplane model — dropdown (Boeing 737, Airbus A320, A380 Demo, Cessna 172)

Date & Time — date + time picker (pure UI)

Departure Airport — dropdown (fixed demo list)

Arrival Airport — dropdown (fixed demo list)

Visualize button

Validation: arrival !== departure with inline error state.

Demo airports & coordinates (use exactly these demo values)

JFK (New York John F. Kennedy) — lat: 40.6413, lon: -73.7781

LAX (Los Angeles Intl) — lat: 33.9416, lon: -118.4085

LHR (London Heathrow) — lat: 51.4700, lon: -0.4543

DEL (Indira Gandhi Intl, Delhi) — lat: 28.5562, lon: 77.1000

DXB (Dubai Intl) — lat: 25.2532, lon: 55.3657

(Keep these coordinates hard-coded for demo mode — no external airport APIs.)

Map & Flight Path visualization

On submit:

Compute and plot the Great-Circle path between chosen departure and arrival using turf.greatCircle or a short custom interpolator. Sample enough points for a smooth route.

Render route as a smooth polyline overlay on the map.

Map UI:

Google Earth–style feel: satellite basemap (if using MapLibre, prefer a free raster tile source or document .env.example for any required tokens — but do not include documentation files). Smooth zoom & drag, optional pitch/tilt if supported.

Zoom controls and full-screen control.

Airplane icon animation:

Airplane marker placed on the path.

Provide:

Slider for scrubbing (0 → 100%).

Play/Pause button to animate the plane along the path (speed control optional).

The airplane rotates to face bearing of travel (compute bearing per segment).

Reset button:

Recenters the map on the airplane's current position and resets zoom/pitch to default.

#### UI & Component structure (suggested)

app/page.tsx — Homepage shell and providers.

components/HeroForm/ — form + validation.

components/Map/ — map wrapper (initializes MapLibre/Mapbox instance).

components/FlightPath/ — renders path, airplane marker, slider, and controls.

hooks/useFlightPath.ts — great-circle calculation & interpolation logic.

lib/gis.ts — small utilities: greatCirclePoints(start, end, n), bearingAt(...), interpolateAlongPath(...).

styles/tailwind.config.js & shadcn theme files.

_Keep components small, typed, and readable. Insert small comments in code where logic is subtle (e.g., why we sample N points, how bearing is computed, map layer update strategy)._

#### Implementation notes / constraints

Demo mode only: airports and coords are hard-coded. No airport lookups.

Prefer MapLibre + free tiles to avoid mandatory API tokens; if a token is used, include .env.example (but do not add README).

Great-circle: prefer turf.greatCircle for simplicity; custom Slerp-style interpolation is acceptable when accompanied by short inline comments explaining the math.

Animation: use requestAnimationFrame. Throttle React state updates and update marker via map API when possible to keep performance smooth. Add brief comments explaining why (performance reason).

Map layers: add/remove or update features rather than re-creating map instance on render. Comment the reasoning briefly.

Types: define clear TS interfaces for Airport, PathPoint, FlightState, etc., with small inline comments where types are not obvious.

Accessibility: slider keyboard operable, controls reachable on mobile.

Code quality & tooling

ESLint with TypeScript + React rules; Prettier for formatting.

pnpm or npm scripts: dev, build, start, lint, format.

Keep code compact and commented where helpful, but do not add full docs or tests.

Acceptance criteria / Definition of done

pnpm install && pnpm dev (or npm) starts the app and homepage loads.

User can select departure and arrival demo airports and click Visualize.

The Great-Circle route is drawn on the map between the demo airports.

Airplane icon appears and is controllable via slider and Play/Pause; it rotates to face travel direction.

Reset recenters the map on the airplane.

ESLint/Prettier run without errors.

Code contains small inline comments that explain non-trivial logic.

Small stylistic & UX suggestions (optional)

Show a small info chip with distance and progress % (computed client-side using the path length) — keep as optional UI element. Add one-line comments where that calculation happens.

Keep the hero form compact on mobile (collapsible map controls) — comment responsive choices inline.



### Prompt 2

Restructure the project such that on submitting the form the data is sent to /flight-map route and the map along with the controls is displayed there. make the inputs as url params.



### Prompt 3

Remove flight details section. flight controls should be on the bottom center of the screen in a floating compact deck form. Max width should not exceed 400px. it should contain current time calculated from start time and arrival time and % distance.


### Prompt 4 
<!-- 
When crossing the international date line the flight path abruptly stops and goes around the globe to cross it. it may be due to the shift from 180 to -180. fix it by maybe omitting drawing the path between the two points crossing the line.

**Agent:** You're absolutely right! The issue is that when crossing the international date line, the longitude jumps from ~180° to ~-180° (or vice versa), causing the flight path to wrap around the globe in the wrong direction. I need to detect these longitude jumps and either break the path or use a different approach for trans-Pacific flights. -->


### Prompt 5

Create a component that renders a realistic 3D sun in the center of the screen using Three.js.

The sun should have a subtle floating/bobbing animation for depth.

Based on the given latitude, longitude, date, and time, calculate the solar elevation and azimuth (using a precise astronomical formula or library).

The calculated angles should control the sun’s 3D tilt and position within its floating container to match the real-world position relative to the given coordinates.

Render a thick 3D ray of light from the center of the sun toward the given position coordinates (representing an aircraft) to visually show the sun’s relative angle.

The ray should be dynamic, adjusting its direction and length according to the computed elevation and azimuth.

Use smooth transitions or easing when the sun’s position or rotation changes.

Also:

Modify the map so the aircraft position is always fixed at the center of the screen. The map should move beneath the aircraft as its coordinates update, keeping the plane centered.

The sun component must remain visually fixed in the center of the screen, but the sun’s actual position inside the component should shift subtly to reflect the real-world angles for a 3D effect.

Optimize for performance with GPU-accelerated transforms and minimal re-renders.

Ensure calculations work for any location, date, and time, including different hemispheres.

Keep the design framework-agnostic except for using Three.js for rendering.
