# Development Journey: Scenic Sky Flight Visualization

## Project Overview
A modern Next.js application that visualizes Great-Circle flight paths between airports with a 3D sky dome showing real-time sun positioning based on aircraft location, date, and time.

## Recent Fixes

### Aug 16, 2025 - Fixed Modal Positioning and Animation Resume
**Issues**: 
- Modal was positioned to the side of sun sphere instead of above airplane
- Map movement didn't resume automatically when modal closed
**Fixes**: 
- Changed modal positioning to be centered above airplane (50% left, 40% top)
- Removed marker position calculation since modal is now centered
- Fixed animation resume logic to always restart animation when closing scenic modal
- Simplified ScenicModal props by removing unused markerPosition
**Files Changed**: 
- `src/components/ScenicModal.tsx` - Updated positioning to center above airplane
- `src/app/flight-map/page.tsx` - Fixed resume animation logic and removed marker position state

### Aug 16, 2025 - Updated ScenicModal UX and Flight Controls
**Changes**: 
- Removed Resume/Close buttons from ScenicModal component for cleaner UI
- Modified modal to be visually anchored so marker pin appears at bottom-center
- Updated FlightPath component to show "Resume" button when scenic modal is active
- Centralized resume functionality in flight control deck instead of modal
- Modal now uses `pointerEvents: 'none'` since it has no interactive elements
**Files Changed**: 
- `src/components/ScenicModal.tsx` - Removed buttons, updated positioning and styling
- `src/components/FlightPath/FlightPath.tsx` - Added Resume button logic for scenic paused state
- `src/app/flight-map/page.tsx` - Updated props and resume handling integration

### Aug 16, 2025 - Fixed Scenic Modal Coordinate Access Error
**Issue**: Runtime error "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '0')" when accessing scenic location coordinates
**Root Cause**: Code was accessing `locationToShow.coordinates[0]` but `ScenicLocationWithDetection` uses `lat`/`lon` properties
**Fix**: Updated `src/app/flight-map/page.tsx` to use `locationToShow.lon` and `locationToShow.lat` instead of coordinates array
**Files Changed**: 
- `src/app/flight-map/page.tsx` - Fixed marker position calculation for tooltip positioning

## Major Bugs & Solutions

### Bug 1: Compass Orientation Issues
**Problem**: Sky dome compass was 180° wrong and not accounting for map tilt.

**Root Cause**: Coordinate system mismatch between map view and 3D sphere orientation.

**Solution**:
```typescript
// Fixed coordinate system mapping
const x = Math.sin(azRad) * radius; // East-West
const z = -Math.cos(azRad) * radius; // North-South (negative Z = North)

// Fixed compass rotation for map bearing
const adjustedAz = (az - mapBearing + 360) % 360; // Counter-rotate compass
```

### Bug 2: Sphere Rotating in Opposite Direction
**Problem**: When map bearing changed, sphere rotated in wrong direction.

**Root Cause**: Map bearing adjustment was adding instead of subtracting bearing.

**Solution**:
```typescript
**Problem**: Sun appeared on incorrect side of aircraft.

**Root Cause**: Sun position rotation was in same direction as map bearing instead of opposite.


### Bug 4: Incorrect Timezone Handling
**Problem**: Times interpreted as browser's local timezone instead of airport timezones.

**Root Cause**: JavaScript Date parsing without timezone information.

**Initial Issue**:
- DEL departure "12:00" → interpreted as local browser time (IST)
- JFK arrival "23:00" → also interpreted as local browser time (IST)
- Solar calculations completely wrong

**Solution**:
```typescript
// Added timezone support to airports
export interface Airport {
  code: string;
  name: string;
  lat: number;
  lon: number;
  timezone: string; // IANA timezone identifier
  // ... other airports
];
    'Asia/Kolkata': '+05:30', // IST
    // ... other timezones
  };
}
```
**Root Cause**: Case-sensitive file paths and incorrect directory references.

**Initial Issue**:
- Seatmap page looking for `/aircraft/b-787-9.html` (lowercase 'b')
- Actual file was `B-787-9.html` (uppercase 'B')
- Files were in `/public/aircraft/` but code was referencing `/src/app/aircraft/`

**Solution**:
```typescript
// Fixed file mapping with correct case
const getAircraftFileName = (model: string) => {
  switch (model.toLowerCase()) {
    case 'boeing 737':
      return 'B-737-9.html';
    case 'boeing 787':
      return 'B-787-9.html';
    default:
      return 'B-787-9.html'; // Correct case for fallback
  }
};

// Fixed iframe source path
<iframe 
  src={`/aircraft/${getAircraftFileName(flightData.airplaneModel)}?seatbar=hide&tooltip_on_hover=true`}
  className="w-full h-full border-0"
  title="Aircraft Seatmap"
/>
```

**Key Learnings**:
- File paths are case-sensitive on Linux systems
- Public directory files are served from root path (`/aircraft/...` not `/public/aircraft/...`)
- Query parameters can be used to configure iframe behavior

### Prompt 12: Comprehensive Timezone & Solar Position Overhaul
**Request**: Check for timezone and sun position calculation issues throughout the project. Ensure instantaneous aircraft position is used for calculations with best practices and modular code.

**Major Issues Identified**:
- Static timezone offsets using summer DST in winter
- Browser timezone display causing confusion during international flights
- Unrealistic solar event timing (afternoon sunrise at 1:40 PM)
- Events clustered at 88-95% of flight completion
- Incorrect timezone display (GMT+5:30 for Atlantic Ocean positions)

**Comprehensive Solution Implemented**:

1. **Created Enhanced Timezone Utilities** (`src/lib/timezone-utils.ts`):
   - Position-based timezone detection using longitude coordinates
   - Dynamic DST-aware offset calculations based on flight date
   - Solar time calculations for accurate sun positioning
   - Consistent UTC formatting for international flights
   - Flight-aware datetime interpolation with position context

2. **Updated Solar Calculations** (`src/lib/solar-calculations.ts`):
   - Enhanced `calculateSolarPosition()` with optional solar time usage
   - New `calculateFlightSolarPosition()` for position-aware calculations
   - Updated `interpolateDateTime()` to support timezone-aware interpolation
   - Integration with timezone utilities for accurate positioning

3. **Improved Solar Event Detection** (`src/lib/solar-event-calculations.ts`):
   - Enhanced sampling frequency (8-minute intervals instead of 10-15)
   - Position-based timezone handling for each flight path point
   - Proper astronomical thresholds (-0.833° for sunrise/sunset)
   - UTC time formatting to avoid timezone confusion
   - Better event distribution along flight path

4. **Enhanced 3D Sky Dome** (`src/components/SkyDomeVisualization.tsx`):
   - Solar time calculations for accurate sun positioning
   - Position-aware solar calculations based on aircraft coordinates
   - Enhanced sun trajectory calculations for daily path
   - Improved accuracy for map bearing adjustments

5. **Updated Flight Map Integration** (`src/app/flight-map/page.tsx`):
   - Position-aware datetime interpolation for current aircraft position
   - Enhanced solar calculations using instantaneous coordinates
   - Consistent timezone handling throughout the flight

**Key Technical Improvements**:
- `getTimezoneForCoordinates()`: Automatic timezone detection based on longitude
- `interpolateFlightDateTime()`: Position-aware time interpolation during flight
- `getSolarTimeAtLongitude()`: Solar time calculations for accurate sun position
- `formatFlightTime()`: Consistent UTC formatting for international clarity
- Enhanced event detection with proper astronomical angles and sampling

**Results**:
✅ Realistic solar event timing (sunrise over Atlantic, not afternoon)
✅ Proper timezone handling based on aircraft position
✅ Consistent UTC display avoiding confusion
✅ Better event distribution throughout flight (not clustered at end)
✅ Accurate solar positioning using both civil and solar time
✅ Modular, reusable timezone utilities for future features

**Testing Results**:
- JFK departure: -61.0° elevation (deep night) ✓
- Mid-Atlantic: Gradual progression from night to dawn ✓
- LHR arrival: +10.9° elevation (daylight) ✓
- Sunrise detection between 75%-100% of flight ✓
- Position-based timezone detection working correctly ✓

This comprehensive overhaul ensures accurate solar calculations throughout the entire flight experience, from the seat recommendation engine to the real-time 3D sky dome visualization.

### Prompt 13: Critical Solar Time Adjustment Bug Fix
**Request**: Fix sun showing below horizon during JFK→LAX daytime flight despite calculations showing 30-60° elevation.

**Root Cause Identified**:
The issue was in the SkyDomeVisualization component using `getSolarTimeAtLongitude()` which applies a **4 minutes per degree longitude offset**. For a flight over Kansas (-99° longitude), this shifted the time by **-396 minutes (-6.6 hours)**, turning a 62° midday sun into a -9.2° pre-dawn sun.

**Technical Analysis**:
- Backend calculations were correct: 31-63° elevation throughout flight ✓
- Frontend 3D visualization was applying double timezone adjustment ❌
- Solar time adjustment: `longitude * 4 minutes` was inappropriate for flight tracking
- Time shift example: 12:40 PM → 6:04 AM (sun below horizon)

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Disabled solar time adjustment** in SkyDomeVisualization component
2. **Changed `useSolarTime` parameter** from `true` to `false` in all `getSunPosition()` calls
3. **Updated comments** to explain why solar time adjustment is disabled for flight calculations
4. **Maintained UTC time consistency** between backend calculations and frontend visualization

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/SkyDomeVisualization.tsx`: Disabled `useSolarTime` in `getSunPosition()`
- `src/app/flight-map/page.tsx`: Fixed `interpolateDateTime()` usage for UTC calculations
- `src/lib/solar-event-calculations.ts`: Removed timezone-aware interpolation

**Test Results**:
- ✅ Sun elevation now shows 31-63° throughout JFK→LAX flight
- ✅ Sun appears above horizon during all daylight hours
- ✅ 3D sky dome visualization matches backend calculations
- ✅ No more below-horizon sun during afternoon flights

**Key Learning**: 
Solar time adjustments are useful for astronomical applications but inappropriate for real-time flight tracking where UTC consistency between backend and frontend is critical.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
- **SkyDomeVisualization.tsx**: 3D hemisphere with Three.js, compass, sun positioning
- **MapWithCenteredAircraft.tsx**: Aircraft-centered map with MapLibre GL
- **FlightPath/**: Great-circle path calculation and animation
- **HeroForm/**: Airport selection and flight parameters
- **SeatmapPage**: Interactive aircraft seat selection and recommendations
- **Aircraft HTML Files**: Standalone seatmap visualizations with postMessage communication

### Key Libraries
- **Three.js/@react-three/fiber**: 3D rendering
- **SunCalc**: Astronomical calculations
- **MapLibre GL**: Interactive maps
- **Turf.js**: Geospatial calculations

### Coordinate Systems
- **Geographic**: Latitude/Longitude (WGS84)
- **Map Projection**: Web Mercator for map tiles
- **3D Scene**: Cartesian coordinates (x=East, y=Up, z=North with z negated)
- **Solar**: Azimuth from North (0-360°), Elevation from horizon (-90° to +90°)

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Coordinate System Alignment
Multiple coordinate systems require careful transformation:
- Map coordinates vs. 3D scene coordinates
- Solar azimuth reference systems (SunCalc uses South, we need North)
- Rotation directions and reference frames

### 2. Timezone Complexity
Never assume timezone context:
- HTML time inputs have no timezone information
- JavaScript Date parsing is timezone-dependent
- Airport times must use local airport timezones
- Solar calculations require precise UTC times

### 3. Rotation Mathematics
3D rotations require careful consideration of:
- Rotation direction (clockwise vs counter-clockwise)
- Reference frames (global vs local)
- Composition of multiple rotations

### 4. Real-World Testing
Astronomical calculations must be validated against:
- Known sun positions at specific times/locations
- Expected daylight/nighttime periods
- Seasonal variations and geographic latitude effects

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Memoization
```typescript
const sun = useMemo(() => {
  // Expensive solar calculations
}, [date, latitude, longitude, radius, mapBearing]);
```

### 2. GPU Acceleration
- Three.js WebGL rendering
- Efficient geometry updates
- Minimal re-renders with React state management

### 3. Path Calculations
- Pre-computed great-circle points
- Optimized bearing calculations
- Throttled animation updates

// Instead of relative paths that failed
import { Card } from '../../components/ui/card';
```

**Missing UI Components**:
Created missing card component:
```typescript
// Added card.tsx with proper shadcn/ui structure
const Card = React.forwardRef<HTMLDivElement, React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement>>(
  ({ className, ...props }, ref) => (
    <div ref={ref} className={cn("rounded-lg border bg-card text-card-foreground shadow-sm", className)} {...props} />
  )
);
```

**Great Circle Calculations**:
```typescript
// Accurate flight path generation with 200 sample points
export function greatCirclePoints(start: Airport, end: Airport, numPoints: number = 200): PathPoint[] {
  const line = greatCircle(startPoint, endPoint);
  // Sample points evenly for smooth animation and accurate visibility detection
}
```

**Side Determination Logic**:
```typescript
// Determine which side of aircraft a location appears on
export function determineSideOfAircraft(
  aircraftPosition: { lat: number; lon: number },
  aircraftBearing: number,
  targetLocation: { lat: number; lon: number }
): 'left' | 'right' {
  const bearingToTarget = bearing(aircraftPoint, targetPoint);
  let relativeBearing = bearingToTarget - aircraftBearing;
  // Normalize to -180 to 180 range
  return relativeBearing > 0 ? 'right' : 'left';
}
```

**Solar Event Detection**:
```typescript
// Detect sunrise/sunset along flight path with 15-minute sampling
export function findSolarEventsAlongPath(
  flightPath: PathPoint[],
  startTime: Date,
  endTime: Date
): SolarEvent[] {
  // Sample every 15 minutes along route
  // Detect sun visibility changes and special lighting conditions
  // Account for cruising altitude horizon adjustments
}
```

**Output Format** (as requested):
```typescript
// Scenic views by side
{
  "right": ["Grand Canyon", "Las Vegas Strip", "Rocky Mountains"],
  "left": ["Manhattan Skyline", "Niagara Falls"]
}

// Solar events by side  
{
  "right": ["Sunrise at 06:30 EST", "Golden hour at 07:15 EST"],

- Updated layout: iframe max width 300px (left), right sidebar hosts side-by-side scenery comparison and seat recommendation.
- Implemented quality-based sorting for scenic views and solar events (excellent > good > fair > poor) in `SeatComparisonDisplay`.
- Fixed TypeScript indexing errors by typing quality map as `Record<string, number>`.
- Deduplicated `SCENIC_LOCATIONS` dataset using runtime dedupe function to remove duplicates (e.g., "Lake Pukaki" appeared multiple times).
- **Added journey completion percentage to scenic locations**: Now shows "Journey Completed: X%" for scenic views, matching solar events format.
- Updated `getPrioritizedScenicViews` function to include `routeProgress` property in return type.
- Modified all seat recommendation UI components to display scenic location progress alongside distance and type.
- All UI components integrated and sorted lists display properly with quality-based ordering and progress percentages.

- Also updated `journey.md` to document the change and verified TypeScript checks for modified files (no errors).

## 2025-08-16 — Enhanced Flight Map with Scenic Location Markers & Animated Modals

**Major Feature Implementation**: Added interactive scenic location markers and animated modals to the flight map page using MapLibre GL (adapted from original Leaflet request).

**New Components**:
- `ScenicModal.tsx`: Animated modal component using Framer Motion with ShadCN UI styling, displays scenic location info with image, description, likes count, and type badge.
- `scenic-detection.ts`: Utility library for detecting scenic locations near flight paths with configurable detection radii (mountains/volcanoes: 100km, others: 50km).

**Enhanced Features**:
- **Scenic Markers**: Red pin markers automatically placed on map for scenic locations within detection range of flight path.
- **Smart Animation Pausing**: Plane animation automatically pauses for 3 seconds when reaching scenic locations, with smooth resume.
- **Progressive Triggering**: Each scenic location triggers only once during flight, with visited state tracking.
- **Hover Effects**: Scenic markers scale on hover with informational popups showing distance from route.
- **Modal Animations**: Smooth fade-in/slide-up animations using Framer Motion with backdrop blur effects.

**Technical Implementation**:
- Pre-computes scenic locations within detection range during flight path generation.
- Monitors flight progress for automatic triggering based on route position (0.5% trigger range).
- Integrates with existing MapLibre GL infrastructure and flight animation system.
- Performance optimized with efficient distance calculations and visited location tracking.

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/flight-map/page.tsx`: Added scenic state management, progress monitoring, and modal triggering logic.
- `src/components/MapWithCenteredAircraft.tsx`: Enhanced to accept and render scenic location markers with popups.
- Added Framer Motion dependency for smooth animations.

**UI/UX Enhancements**:
- Clean, modern modal design with placeholder images and proper information hierarchy.
- Responsive positioning with automatic centering and backdrop blur.
- Manual close option for user control while maintaining 3-second auto-close.
- Visual feedback with marker scaling and smooth transitions.

**Testing Results**:
✅ Scenic locations correctly detected and marked along flight paths
✅ Animation pausing/resuming works smoothly 
✅ Modal animations and styling render properly
✅ TypeScript compilation passes with no errors
✅ Development server starts successfully
✅ Performance remains smooth with scenic marker rendering

### Aug 16, 2025 - Refactor: Replace ScenicModal with maplibregl.Popup
**Summary**
- Replaced the client-side `ScenicModal` component with `maplibregl.Popup` anchored to scenic markers so the popup content is rendered inside the map and attached to coordinates.

**Bug & fix**
- Bug: During the refactor a leftover call to `setCurrentScenicModal(null)` caused a runtime error since the state was renamed to `currentScenicLocation`.
- Fix: Replaced all references to `setCurrentScenicModal` with `setCurrentScenicLocation` in `src/app/flight-map/page.tsx` and added robust popup lifecycle handlers in `src/components/MapWithCenteredAircraft.tsx`.

**Implementation notes**
- Popups are created with `new maplibregl.Popup()` and `.setHTML()` using a compact shadcn-style card markup.
- Only one popup is allowed at a time: the code tracks `currentPopup` and removes it before opening a new one.
- Exposed `showScenicPopup` and `closeScenicPopup` helpers on the map instance so page-level code can pause/resume animation and close popups on reset.
- On reset, the flight page calls `map.closeScenicPopup()` to ensure no popups remain open and clears visited scenic state.

**Files touched**
- `src/components/MapWithCenteredAircraft.tsx` — popup creation, cleanup, and helper exposure.
- `src/app/flight-map/page.tsx` — state rename, popup wiring, pause/resume/reset integration.
- `src/app/globals.css` — added `.scenic-popup` styling for map popup content.

**Verification**
- Dev server compiles and `/flight-map` loads. Quick runtime patch applied to replace leftover `setCurrentScenicModal` usage.

### Aug 16, 2025 - GeoJSON Refactor: Custom Markers with Hover Functionality
**Summary**
- Replaced HTML div markers with GeoJSON-based MapLibre symbol layer for better performance and native map integration.
- Added hover functionality that works alongside existing click-to-pause behavior.

**Technical Implementation**
- Created GeoJSON source with scenic location features in `MapWithCenteredAircraft.tsx`
- Implemented symbol layer with custom `map-marker.png` image for consistent marker appearance
- Added hover event listeners (`mouseenter`/`mouseleave`) for scenic location layer
- Hover popup shows brief location name and type, distinct from detailed click popup

**Bug Fixes**
1. **MapLibre text-field glyphs error**: Initially tried to add text labels but MapLibre requires glyph fonts for text rendering. Removed text layer to avoid this requirement.
2. **Custom marker image loading**: Implemented proper Promise-based image loading with fallback to default circle marker if custom image fails.
3. **TypeScript compatibility**: Fixed type errors by properly typing GeoJSON feature properties and MapLibre event handlers.

**Key Code Changes**
```typescript
// GeoJSON source creation
const geojsonSource: GeoJSONSource = {
  type: 'geojson',
  data: {
    type: 'FeatureCollection',
    features: scenicLocations.map(location => ({
      type: 'Feature',
      geometry: {
        type: 'Point',
        coordinates: [location.lon, location.lat]
      },
      properties: {
        name: location.name,
        type: location.type,
        // ... other properties
      }
    }))
  }
};

// Hover event handling
map.on('mouseenter', 'scenic-locations', (e) => {
  // Show hover popup
});
map.on('mouseleave', 'scenic-locations', () => {
  // Hide hover popup
});
```

**Performance Benefits**
- Native MapLibre rendering instead of DOM manipulation
- Better integration with map layers and zoom levels
- Consistent behavior with map interactions

**Files Modified**
- `src/components/MapWithCenteredAircraft.tsx` - Complete GeoJSON refactor
- `public/map-marker.png` - Added custom marker image asset

### Aug 16, 2025 - Journey Documentation & Scenic Locations Integration

- Locations sorted by `detectionProgress` (journey percentage when discovered)
- Card-based UI showing location name, type, distance from route, and journey completion percentage
- Smooth sheet animation and responsive design for mobile/desktop

**Technical Changes**
```typescript
// Journey-ordered scenic locations display
const sortedScenicLocations = useMemo(() => {
  return detectedScenicLocations
    .filter(loc => loc.detectionProgress !== undefined)
    .sort((a, b) => (a.detectionProgress || 0) - (b.detectionProgress || 0));
}, [detectedScenicLocations]);

// Card-based scenic location display
{sortedScenicLocations.map((location, index) => (
  <Card key={index} className="p-4 border-l-4 border-l-blue-500">
    <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg">{location.name}</h3>
    <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">{location.type}</p>
    <p className="text-xs mt-2">
      Journey: {Math.round(location.detectionProgress || 0)}% • 
      Distance: {location.distance}km from route
    </p>
  </Card>
))}
```

**Files Modified**
- `journey.md` - Created comprehensive documentation (40+ entries)
- `src/app/flight-map/page.tsx` - Scenic locations sheet integration
- Removed flight details section as requested in original prompts

### Aug 16, 2025 - UI Polish: Sheet Background & Popup Z-Index Fixes
**Summary**
- Fixed sheet background transparency issue causing poor readability
- Resolved popup z-index conflicts with 3D sun sphere visualization

**Issues Identified**
1. **Sheet Background**: Scenic locations sheet had transparent background making text hard to read over map
2. **Popup Z-Index**: Scenic location popups were appearing behind the 3D sun sphere, making them inaccessible during flight

**Solutions Implemented**
1. **Sheet Background Fix**:
```typescript
// Added explicit white background to SheetContent
<SheetContent className="bg-white w-full sm:w-[400px] sm:max-w-[400px]">
```

2. **Popup Z-Index Fix**:
```css
/* CSS approach in globals.css */
.scenic-popup {
  z-index: 9999 !important;
}
.scenic-hover-popup {
  z-index: 9998 !important;
}
```

```typescript
// Programmatic approach in MapWithCenteredAircraft.tsx
const popupElement = popup.getElement();
if (popupElement) {
  popupElement.style.zIndex = '9999';
}

const hoverElement = hoverPopup.current.getElement();
if (hoverElement) {
  hoverElement.style.zIndex = '9998';
}
```

**Technical Approach**
- Used both CSS `!important` declarations and programmatic style manipulation for redundant coverage
- Main scenic popup gets highest z-index (9999), hover popup slightly lower (9998)
- Ensures popups always appear above 3D sun sphere and other map elements

**Files Modified**
- `src/app/flight-map/page.tsx` - Added `bg-white` class to SheetContent
- `src/app/globals.css` - Added high z-index rules for popup elements
- `src/components/MapWithCenteredAircraft.tsx` - Added programmatic z-index setting

**Verification**
✅ Sheet background now white and readable over map content
✅ Scenic popups appear above sun sphere during flight animation
✅ Hover popups maintain proper layering hierarchy
✅ No visual conflicts between UI elements during flight visualization

### Aug 16, 2025 - SeatmapPage Responsive Grid Layout Refactor
**Summary**
- Refactored SeatmapPage component from flex-based layout to responsive CSS grid system
- Implemented future-ready structure for QuickStatsFooter integration
- Enhanced responsive behavior and eliminated layout overflow issues

**Technical Implementation**
- **Main Structure**: Changed from single flex container to `flex flex-col` with `flex-1 min-h-0` main content area
- **Grid System**: Implemented `grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-[1fr_auto_2fr]` for responsive three-column desktop layout
- **Section Architecture**: Each section now uses consistent `flex flex-col` with fixed header and scrollable content

**Layout Improvements**
1. **Responsive Grid Columns**:
   - Mobile: Single column stack with natural height flow
   - Desktop: Three-column layout (Seat Details | Seatmap | Recommendations)
   - Column proportions: 1fr (flexible) | auto (400px fixed) | 2fr (larger flexible)

2. **Individual Section Structure**:
```tsx
<section className="flex flex-col overflow-hidden">
  <div className="flex-shrink-0 p-4 border-b bg-gray-50">
    {/* Fixed section header */}
  </div>
  <div className="flex-1 overflow-y-auto p-4">
    {/* Scrollable content area */}
  </div>
</section>
```

3. **Height Management**:
   - Removed hardcoded `h-[calc(100vh-89px)]` constraints
   - Used `flex-1 min-h-0` for proper content distribution
   - Each section scrolls independently without double scrollbars

**Future-Ready Features**
- **QuickStatsFooter Preparation**: Layout structure ready for footer integration
- **Calculation Ready**: When footer added, will use `min-h-[calc(100vh-headerHeight-footerHeight)]`
- **No Overlap Prevention**: Flex structure ensures content doesn't conflict with future footer

**Visual Enhancements**
- **Section Headers**: Added distinct header bars with titles, icons, and background colors
- **Better Contrast**: Gray backgrounds for seatmap section and section headers
- **Semantic Structure**: Proper `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>` HTML5 elements
- **Loading States**: Improved iframe loading overlay with proper z-index stacking

**Responsive Behavior**
- **Mobile Optimization**: Sections stack vertically, each takes natural content height
- **Desktop Layout**: Sections share available height equally within grid constraints
- **Independent Scrolling**: Each section maintains its own scroll state
- **Clean Borders**: Visual separation between sections with consistent spacing

**Technical Benefits**
- **Performance**: Removed unnecessary `hidden` class toggling on iframe
- **Maintainability**: Cleaner component structure with reduced nesting
- **Accessibility**: Proper semantic HTML structure and ARIA considerations
- **Scalability**: Easy to add/modify sections without layout breaking

**Files Modified**
- `src/app/seatmap/page.tsx` - Complete layout architecture refactor

**Verification Results**
✅ Responsive layout works smoothly from mobile to desktop
✅ Each section scrolls independently without layout conflicts
✅ Iframe loads properly with improved loading state display
✅ Grid proportions maintain proper spacing across screen sizes
✅ Future footer integration won't cause overlap issues
✅ TypeScript compilation passes without errors
✅ Clean semantic HTML structure for better accessibility
