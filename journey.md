- MapLibre GL for interactive maps
- Turf.js for Great-Circle calculations
- shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS for styling
- Airplane animation along flight paths

### Prompt 2: Route-Based Architecture
**Request**: Restructure to send form data to `/flight-map` route with URL parameters.

**Implementation**:
- Form submission redirects to `/flight-map` with query parameters
- Separated hero form from map visualization
- URL-based state management for flight parameters

### Prompt 3: UI Refinement
**Request**: Remove flight details section, create floating compact control deck with time/distance info.

**Implementation**:
- Compact floating controls at bottom center (max 400px width)
- Current time calculation from start/arrival times
- Progress percentage display

### Prompt 4: International Date Line Fix
**Request**: Fix flight path wrapping around globe when crossing international date line.

**Implementation**:
- Detected longitude jumps from ~180° to ~-180°
- Implemented path segmentation to avoid incorrect globe wrapping
- Used great-circle calculations that respect shortest path

**Implementation**:
- Floating button in top-left corner of flight map
- Seat recommendation logic based on flight type (long-haul vs short-haul)
- Real-time seat selection with postMessage API communication

## Major Bugs & Solutions

### Bug 1: Compass Orientation Issues
**Problem**: Sky dome compass was 180° wrong and not accounting for map tilt.

**Root Cause**: Coordinate system mismatch between map view and 3D sphere orientation.

**Solution**:
```typescript
// Fixed coordinate system mapping
const x = Math.sin(azRad) * radius; // East-West
const z = -Math.cos(azRad) * radius; // North-South (negative Z = North)

// Fixed compass rotation for map bearing
const adjustedAz = (az - mapBearing + 360) % 360; // Counter-rotate compass
```

### Bug 2: Sphere Rotating in Opposite Direction
**Problem**: When map bearing changed, sphere rotated in wrong direction.

**Root Cause**: Map bearing adjustment was adding instead of subtracting bearing.

**Solution**:
```typescript
**Problem**: Sun appeared on incorrect side of aircraft.

**Root Cause**: Sun position rotation was in same direction as map bearing instead of opposite.


### Bug 4: Incorrect Timezone Handling
**Problem**: Times interpreted as browser's local timezone instead of airport timezones.

**Root Cause**: JavaScript Date parsing without timezone information.

**Initial Issue**:
- DEL departure "12:00" → interpreted as local browser time (IST)
- JFK arrival "23:00" → also interpreted as local browser time (IST)
- Solar calculations completely wrong

**Solution**:
```typescript
// Added timezone support to airports
export interface Airport {
  code: string;
  name: string;
  lat: number;
  lon: number;
  timezone: string; // IANA timezone identifier
  // ... other airports
];
    'Asia/Kolkata': '+05:30', // IST
    // ... other timezones
  };
}
```
**Root Cause**: Case-sensitive file paths and incorrect directory references.

**Initial Issue**:
- Seatmap page looking for `/aircraft/b-787-9.html` (lowercase 'b')
- Actual file was `B-787-9.html` (uppercase 'B')
- Files were in `/public/aircraft/` but code was referencing `/src/app/aircraft/`

**Solution**:
```typescript
// Fixed file mapping with correct case
const getAircraftFileName = (model: string) => {
  switch (model.toLowerCase()) {
    case 'boeing 737':
      return 'B-737-9.html';
    case 'boeing 787':
      return 'B-787-9.html';
    default:
      return 'B-787-9.html'; // Correct case for fallback
  }
};

// Fixed iframe source path
<iframe 
  src={`/aircraft/${getAircraftFileName(flightData.airplaneModel)}?seatbar=hide&tooltip_on_hover=true`}
  className="w-full h-full border-0"
  title="Aircraft Seatmap"
/>
```

**Key Learnings**:
- File paths are case-sensitive on Linux systems
- Public directory files are served from root path (`/aircraft/...` not `/public/aircraft/...`)
- Query parameters can be used to configure iframe behavior

### Prompt 12: Comprehensive Timezone & Solar Position Overhaul
**Request**: Check for timezone and sun position calculation issues throughout the project. Ensure instantaneous aircraft position is used for calculations with best practices and modular code.

**Major Issues Identified**:
- Static timezone offsets using summer DST in winter
- Browser timezone display causing confusion during international flights
- Unrealistic solar event timing (afternoon sunrise at 1:40 PM)
- Events clustered at 88-95% of flight completion
- Incorrect timezone display (GMT+5:30 for Atlantic Ocean positions)

**Comprehensive Solution Implemented**:

1. **Created Enhanced Timezone Utilities** (`src/lib/timezone-utils.ts`):
   - Position-based timezone detection using longitude coordinates
   - Dynamic DST-aware offset calculations based on flight date
   - Solar time calculations for accurate sun positioning
   - Consistent UTC formatting for international flights
   - Flight-aware datetime interpolation with position context

2. **Updated Solar Calculations** (`src/lib/solar-calculations.ts`):
   - Enhanced `calculateSolarPosition()` with optional solar time usage
   - New `calculateFlightSolarPosition()` for position-aware calculations
   - Updated `interpolateDateTime()` to support timezone-aware interpolation
   - Integration with timezone utilities for accurate positioning

3. **Improved Solar Event Detection** (`src/lib/solar-event-calculations.ts`):
   - Enhanced sampling frequency (8-minute intervals instead of 10-15)
   - Position-based timezone handling for each flight path point
   - Proper astronomical thresholds (-0.833° for sunrise/sunset)
   - UTC time formatting to avoid timezone confusion
   - Better event distribution along flight path

4. **Enhanced 3D Sky Dome** (`src/components/SkyDomeVisualization.tsx`):
   - Solar time calculations for accurate sun positioning
   - Position-aware solar calculations based on aircraft coordinates
   - Enhanced sun trajectory calculations for daily path
   - Improved accuracy for map bearing adjustments

5. **Updated Flight Map Integration** (`src/app/flight-map/page.tsx`):
   - Position-aware datetime interpolation for current aircraft position
   - Enhanced solar calculations using instantaneous coordinates
   - Consistent timezone handling throughout the flight

**Key Technical Improvements**:
- `getTimezoneForCoordinates()`: Automatic timezone detection based on longitude
- `interpolateFlightDateTime()`: Position-aware time interpolation during flight
- `getSolarTimeAtLongitude()`: Solar time calculations for accurate sun position
- `formatFlightTime()`: Consistent UTC formatting for international clarity
- Enhanced event detection with proper astronomical angles and sampling

**Results**:
✅ Realistic solar event timing (sunrise over Atlantic, not afternoon)
✅ Proper timezone handling based on aircraft position
✅ Consistent UTC display avoiding confusion
✅ Better event distribution throughout flight (not clustered at end)
✅ Accurate solar positioning using both civil and solar time
✅ Modular, reusable timezone utilities for future features

**Testing Results**:
- JFK departure: -61.0° elevation (deep night) ✓
- Mid-Atlantic: Gradual progression from night to dawn ✓
- LHR arrival: +10.9° elevation (daylight) ✓
- Sunrise detection between 75%-100% of flight ✓
- Position-based timezone detection working correctly ✓

This comprehensive overhaul ensures accurate solar calculations throughout the entire flight experience, from the seat recommendation engine to the real-time 3D sky dome visualization.

### Prompt 13: Critical Solar Time Adjustment Bug Fix
**Request**: Fix sun showing below horizon during JFK→LAX daytime flight despite calculations showing 30-60° elevation.

**Root Cause Identified**:
The issue was in the SkyDomeVisualization component using `getSolarTimeAtLongitude()` which applies a **4 minutes per degree longitude offset**. For a flight over Kansas (-99° longitude), this shifted the time by **-396 minutes (-6.6 hours)**, turning a 62° midday sun into a -9.2° pre-dawn sun.

**Technical Analysis**:
- Backend calculations were correct: 31-63° elevation throughout flight ✓
- Frontend 3D visualization was applying double timezone adjustment ❌
- Solar time adjustment: `longitude * 4 minutes` was inappropriate for flight tracking
- Time shift example: 12:40 PM → 6:04 AM (sun below horizon)

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Disabled solar time adjustment** in SkyDomeVisualization component
2. **Changed `useSolarTime` parameter** from `true` to `false` in all `getSunPosition()` calls
3. **Updated comments** to explain why solar time adjustment is disabled for flight calculations
4. **Maintained UTC time consistency** between backend calculations and frontend visualization

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/SkyDomeVisualization.tsx`: Disabled `useSolarTime` in `getSunPosition()`
- `src/app/flight-map/page.tsx`: Fixed `interpolateDateTime()` usage for UTC calculations
- `src/lib/solar-event-calculations.ts`: Removed timezone-aware interpolation

**Test Results**:
- ✅ Sun elevation now shows 31-63° throughout JFK→LAX flight
- ✅ Sun appears above horizon during all daylight hours
- ✅ 3D sky dome visualization matches backend calculations
- ✅ No more below-horizon sun during afternoon flights

**Key Learning**: 
Solar time adjustments are useful for astronomical applications but inappropriate for real-time flight tracking where UTC consistency between backend and frontend is critical.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
- **SkyDomeVisualization.tsx**: 3D hemisphere with Three.js, compass, sun positioning
- **MapWithCenteredAircraft.tsx**: Aircraft-centered map with MapLibre GL
- **FlightPath/**: Great-circle path calculation and animation
- **HeroForm/**: Airport selection and flight parameters
- **SeatmapPage**: Interactive aircraft seat selection and recommendations
- **Aircraft HTML Files**: Standalone seatmap visualizations with postMessage communication

### Key Libraries
- **Three.js/@react-three/fiber**: 3D rendering
- **SunCalc**: Astronomical calculations
- **MapLibre GL**: Interactive maps
- **Turf.js**: Geospatial calculations

### Coordinate Systems
- **Geographic**: Latitude/Longitude (WGS84)
- **Map Projection**: Web Mercator for map tiles
- **3D Scene**: Cartesian coordinates (x=East, y=Up, z=North with z negated)
- **Solar**: Azimuth from North (0-360°), Elevation from horizon (-90° to +90°)

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Coordinate System Alignment
Multiple coordinate systems require careful transformation:
- Map coordinates vs. 3D scene coordinates
- Solar azimuth reference systems (SunCalc uses South, we need North)
- Rotation directions and reference frames

### 2. Timezone Complexity
Never assume timezone context:
- HTML time inputs have no timezone information
- JavaScript Date parsing is timezone-dependent
- Airport times must use local airport timezones
- Solar calculations require precise UTC times

### 3. Rotation Mathematics
3D rotations require careful consideration of:
- Rotation direction (clockwise vs counter-clockwise)
- Reference frames (global vs local)
- Composition of multiple rotations

### 4. Real-World Testing
Astronomical calculations must be validated against:
- Known sun positions at specific times/locations
- Expected daylight/nighttime periods
- Seasonal variations and geographic latitude effects

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Memoization
```typescript
const sun = useMemo(() => {
  // Expensive solar calculations
}, [date, latitude, longitude, radius, mapBearing]);
```

### 2. GPU Acceleration
- Three.js WebGL rendering
- Efficient geometry updates
- Minimal re-renders with React state management

### 3. Path Calculations
- Pre-computed great-circle points
- Optimized bearing calculations
- Throttled animation updates

// Instead of relative paths that failed
import { Card } from '../../components/ui/card';
```

**Missing UI Components**:
Created missing card component:
```typescript
// Added card.tsx with proper shadcn/ui structure
const Card = React.forwardRef<HTMLDivElement, React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement>>(
  ({ className, ...props }, ref) => (
    <div ref={ref} className={cn("rounded-lg border bg-card text-card-foreground shadow-sm", className)} {...props} />
  )
);
```

**Great Circle Calculations**:
```typescript
// Accurate flight path generation with 200 sample points
export function greatCirclePoints(start: Airport, end: Airport, numPoints: number = 200): PathPoint[] {
  const line = greatCircle(startPoint, endPoint);
  // Sample points evenly for smooth animation and accurate visibility detection
}
```

**Side Determination Logic**:
```typescript
// Determine which side of aircraft a location appears on
export function determineSideOfAircraft(
  aircraftPosition: { lat: number; lon: number },
  aircraftBearing: number,
  targetLocation: { lat: number; lon: number }
): 'left' | 'right' {
  const bearingToTarget = bearing(aircraftPoint, targetPoint);
  let relativeBearing = bearingToTarget - aircraftBearing;
  // Normalize to -180 to 180 range
  return relativeBearing > 0 ? 'right' : 'left';
}
```

**Solar Event Detection**:
```typescript
// Detect sunrise/sunset along flight path with 15-minute sampling
export function findSolarEventsAlongPath(
  flightPath: PathPoint[],
  startTime: Date,
  endTime: Date
): SolarEvent[] {
  // Sample every 15 minutes along route
  // Detect sun visibility changes and special lighting conditions
  // Account for cruising altitude horizon adjustments
}
```

**Output Format** (as requested):
```typescript
// Scenic views by side
{
  "right": ["Grand Canyon", "Las Vegas Strip", "Rocky Mountains"],
  "left": ["Manhattan Skyline", "Niagara Falls"]
}

// Solar events by side  
{
  "right": ["Sunrise at 06:30 EST", "Golden hour at 07:15 EST"],
